# SolarSimulation

Final project for a scientific computing course. Work in progress.

The end goal is a galaxy simulation with N=10^6 bodies. Algorithms for estimating forces between objects will have to be implemented, approximating by center of mass and distance, grouping bodies far away together to ease calculations.
Current progress is a small solar system model with two bodies; heavy work on equation models needed before further developments on simulating a galaxy.
